# Decisions

Record only durable design decisions here. Keep each entry short: date, decision, reason, and consequence.

### 2026-03-01: Animated tile metadata layers onto a static frame-zero render source

- Decision: Optional tile render animation metadata stays additive to the existing static `atlasIndex` / `uvRect`; when `frames` are present, `frameDurationMs` is required and `frames[0]` must resolve to the same UV rect as the static render source.
- Reason: The current mesher and renderer still consume one static UV rect per non-terrain tile, so animated tiles need a deterministic frame-zero fallback before render-time animation sampling exists.
- Consequence: Future animated tiles should always define a valid static frame-zero source, and later renderer animation work should sample the compiled animation lookup instead of bypassing the existing static UV metadata path.

### 2026-03-01: Manual camera inspection adjusts follow offset instead of disabling player follow

- Decision: Standalone player camera follow now targets the player body center by default, while manual pan and zoom input is preserved by folding camera deltas into a persistent follow offset instead of toggling into a separate free-camera mode.
- Reason: Mixed-device play needs player-centric framing, but debug inspection still needs drag and pinch camera control without fighting a second camera state machine.
- Consequence: Future camera controls should usually modify the follow offset or explicitly introduce a higher-level shell state, rather than bypassing player follow by mutating `Camera2D` indefinitely.

### 2026-03-01: Player input should resolve into movement intent before physics stepping

- Decision: Standalone player walk and jump behavior now enter the simulation as a normalized movement-intent object that the player-state helper resolves into horizontal velocity, jump impulse, gravity, and collision stepping.
- Reason: This keeps device-specific bindings out of the world layer, gives desktop and touch controllers one shared contract to target, and preserves a single fixed-step path for future entity migration.
- Consequence: Future input work should map controls into movement intent and call the shared player-step helper instead of mutating player velocity directly in `src/main.ts` or `src/input`.

### 2026-03-01: Standalone player gravity is applied before collision stepping

- Decision: The spawned standalone player now applies gravity and fall-speed clamping to `velocity.y` before each fixed-step collision move, rather than re-running spawn placement or using a separate gravity path.
- Reason: This makes unsupported players start falling immediately, keeps resting-on-ground behavior stable through the same collision helper, and gives later movement work one fixed-step path to extend.
- Consequence: Future walk, jump, respawn, or entity migration work should layer onto the gravity-step helper instead of introducing parallel gravity integration or bypassing the shared collision sweep order.

### 2026-03-01: Player collision stepping resolves horizontal then vertical sweeps

- Decision: Standalone player collision stepping moves the player through an `x` sweep first, then a `y` sweep, and determines `grounded` from a post-move support probe instead of trusting prior grounded state.
- Reason: This keeps fixed-step movement deterministic, lets wall and ceiling hits zero only the blocked axis, and makes ledge walk-off behavior correct even before gravity and input forces are layered in.
- Consequence: Future standalone-controller or entity migration work should reuse the shared collision-step helper for grounded resolution rather than introducing separate per-system sweep order or support checks.

### 2026-03-01: Player state uses a feet-centered position anchor

- Decision: Standalone player state stores `position` at the player's bottom center and derives the collision AABB from explicit `size`.
- Reason: Spawn search already resolves a standing feet position plus AABB, and sharing that anchor avoids ad hoc transforms between spawn, collision, and future controller code.
- Consequence: Player movement, debug markers, and later entity migration should treat player `position` as bottom-center world space and use the shared AABB helper instead of introducing alternate anchor conventions.

### 2026-02-28: Simulation runs in fixed steps, rendering interpolates

- Decision: Authoritative game state advances in the fixed `60hz` update loop, while rendering receives interpolation alpha and frame timing separately.
- Reason: This keeps simulation hooks deterministic and gives later systems like player movement, entities, lighting, and networking a stable update model.
- Consequence: New gameplay state should update in fixed-step code paths. Render code can smooth presentation, but should not become the source of truth for simulation state.

### 2026-02-28: Tile metadata is the source of truth for tile behavior and rendering

- Decision: Tile render data, terrain connectivity, and gameplay flags live in validated tile metadata and are resolved through the metadata registry instead of scattered hardcoded tile rules.
- Reason: The project already uses tile metadata to drive meshing and gameplay tags, which keeps authored content extensible and avoids duplicating tile semantics across subsystems.
- Consequence: New tile types or tile-specific behavior should usually start with metadata schema and validation updates, then consume that data from helpers instead of adding ad hoc tile ID conditionals.

### 2026-02-28: Metadata compiles into dense hot-path lookup tables

- Decision: After validation, tile metadata is compiled into dense lookup structures such as typed arrays and flattened tables for gameplay and render queries.
- Reason: Meshing already runs in hot loops, and planned systems like collision, liquids, and lighting will need predictable per-tile access without repeated parsing or allocation.
- Consequence: Preserve the compile-once, lookup-many pattern for hot-path tile queries. Avoid re-reading raw metadata or constructing new objects inside per-tile simulation or meshing loops.

### 2026-02-28: Mixed-device editing features share underlying state and actions

- Decision: Desktop and touch debug-edit workflows share the same conceptual state for mode, brush selection, undo history, and armed one-shot tools, even when the interaction surfaces differ.
- Reason: This project targets mixed-device play, and the current tooling already treats desktop shortcuts, touch gestures, and on-screen controls as alternate views over the same editing model.
- Consequence: New edit or inspect features should usually be implemented in shared controller or state layers first, then exposed through device-specific bindings rather than forked behavior.

### 2026-02-28: Chunk rendering stays simple until a stronger need exists

- Decision: World chunks are currently meshed as one quad per non-empty tile and built through a budgeted queue instead of introducing greedy meshing or more complex visibility rules early.
- Reason: The current renderer favors correctness, debuggability, and incremental evolution over early geometric optimization.
- Consequence: Future performance work should first preserve the existing simple chunk pipeline and optimize around lookup tables, queueing, and cache behavior before replacing the mesh model outright.
