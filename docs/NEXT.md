# Next incremental tasks

1. Replace placeholder atlas with authored asset pipeline and tile metadata.
2. Add line-stepped stroke interpolation for desktop/touch debug drag painting so fast swipes do not leave tile gaps.
3. Implement collision grid + simple player controller.
4. Add water/lava tile animation and autotiling rules.
5. Introduce basic lighting (sunlight + torch flood fill).
6. Add entity layer and interpolation between fixed updates.
7. Add save/load format for chunk snapshots.
8. Prepare networking scaffolding (state diff messages, interest management).
9. Add a main menu shell and move debug overlay to a UI toggle.
10. Add a shared debug brush palette UI (tile picker + active brush indicator) for desktop/touch editing instead of hard-coded `debug_brick`.
