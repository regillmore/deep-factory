# Next incremental tasks

1. Replace placeholder atlas with authored asset pipeline and tile metadata.
2. Implement collision grid + simple player controller.
3. Add water/lava tile animation and autotiling rules.
4. Introduce basic lighting (sunlight + torch flood fill).
5. Add entity layer and interpolation between fixed updates.
6. Add save/load format for chunk snapshots.
7. Prepare networking scaffolding (state diff messages, interest management).
8. Add a main menu shell and move debug overlay to a UI toggle.
9. Add keyboard shortcuts for shared debug edit controls (brush slot hotkeys/cycle + undo/redo bindings) and surface the bindings in the debug UI.
10. Add touch gesture shortcuts for debug edit history (`two-finger tap` undo / `three-finger tap` redo) with debounce/conflict guards so they do not fight pinch zoom.
