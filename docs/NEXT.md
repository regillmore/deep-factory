# Next incremental tasks

1. Replace placeholder atlas with authored asset pipeline and tile metadata.
2. Implement collision grid + simple player controller.
3. Add water/lava tile animation and autotiling rules.
4. Introduce basic lighting (sunlight + torch flood fill).
5. Add entity layer and interpolation between fixed updates.
6. Add save/load format for chunk snapshots.
7. Prepare networking scaffolding (state diff messages, interest management).
8. Add a main menu shell and move debug overlay to a UI toggle.
9. Persist debug edit control state (`touch mode` + active `brush` tile) across reloads with safe fallback when tile metadata changes.
10. Add a debug-edit eyedropper (desktop shortcut + touch long-press) to set the active brush from the hovered tile.
