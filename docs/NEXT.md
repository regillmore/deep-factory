# Next incremental tasks

1. Replace placeholder atlas with authored asset pipeline and tile metadata.
2. Implement collision grid + simple player controller.
3. Add water/lava tile animation and autotiling rules.
4. Introduce basic lighting (sunlight + torch flood fill).
5. Add entity layer and interpolation between fixed updates.
6. Add save/load format for chunk snapshots.
7. Prepare networking scaffolding (state diff messages, interest management).
8. Add a main menu shell and move debug overlay to a UI toggle.
9. Show pinned and hovered inspect outlines simultaneously so a locked tile can stay visible while desktop users compare nearby targets.
